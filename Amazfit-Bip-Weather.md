Amazfit Bip support a weather function to show current weather/temperature at your location and forecast for the following days. 
Gadgetbridge offers support for weather information on the Bip. To do this without requiring the INTERNET permission for itself, this requires the help of a weather provider on your Android device – which is provided by the "Weather notification" app available at F-Droid.

## Install and configure "Weather notification"
Look for "Weather notification" in F-droid or [https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ru.gelin.android.weather.notification/](download it from F-droid website). You must enable the Gadgetbridge skin in the "Weather notification" app: start the app, and flip the Gadgetbridge skin switch as shown in the screenshot. Also make sure that you have the „Enable Notification“ switch enabled. Set the location as desired and feel free to adjust the other settings (some of them apply only for Pebble watches, and don't affect the Bip).

Now, enjoy the weather on your Bip!

## Other weather providers for Android
Meteo function should work without additional app  on LineageOS/Cyanogenmod that provide system with weather provider.
