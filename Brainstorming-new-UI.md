# This is a collection of proposals, not a roadmap!
* use a drawer in the main activity: in the drawer list show a list of currently known devices: in the main fragment the available action for the currently selected device (doesn't have to be necessarily connected)
 * the drawer could contain also a link to settings (to add new devices etc)
 * the mail fragment could show big buttons (think two buttons per row) with graphic with all and only the actions that make sense for the selected device (sync, show activity data, set alarms, manage pebble apps...)
 * PROBLEM: what do we show to users that start GB for the first time / do not have any configured device?
* use a snackbar instead of the notifications when possible (e.g. syncronization progress)
