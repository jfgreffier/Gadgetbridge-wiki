You can interact with incoming calls and SMS from your Pebble. For advanced features, you need to prepare your own Canned Replies:

## Configure Canned Replies
This can be done from the [Pebble specific settings](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Configuration#pebble-specific-settings) in the "Canned Messages" section.

<sup>Configure messages for call rejection</sup>

Tap an empty row here to add a new message, tap an existing entry to modify. When done, tap the top-row to "Update on Pebble" – i.e. to send your changes to your Pebble and make them available there.


## Reject calls
### Simple call rejection

<sup>Simple call rejection (with no canned responses set up)</sup>

With no canned messages set up, you can still reject incoming calls – as the screenshots above show: push the lower-right button, done. You'll see a simple red screen confirming the call was rejected (or "declined").

### Advanced call rejection

<sup>Advanced call rejection with canned replies</sup>

Having set up some canned messages, you'll have one additional button available on incoming calls: pushing the upper-right button on your Pebble now first rejects the call, and then brings you to a menu as shown in the second screenshot. Now push the middle-right button for "Canned Messages", and you will see the messages you've setup before. Select one, and it is sent to the caller.
