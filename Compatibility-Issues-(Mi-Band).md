## Moto G (2013)
It looks like the Moto G, at least with Android 4.4.x (KitKat) has a problem with the Mi Band. It might be a problem with the Bluetooth stack of KitKat or even Moto G's Bluetooth device. 
Occurred with Mi Band firmware versions 
* 1.4.0.3 (everything in Gadgetbridge works **except** fetching activity data)
* 1.0.9.14 (nothing works, cannot even connect properly)
