# What Does Gadgetbridge do?
 Gadgetbridge is an Android (4.4+) Application which will allow you to use your Pebble or Mi Band without the vendor's closed source application and without the need to create an account and transmit any of your data to the vendor's servers.

# What devices work with Gadgetbridge?
  Gadgetbridge so far works with the Pebble smartwatch and the Miband, primarily because that's what the developers own.  It is not designed to be specific to those devices and interested people are encouraged to add support to [Other devices](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/issues/50)
