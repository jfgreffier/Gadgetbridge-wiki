All Pebbles when powered up for the first time demand that you connect in via the official App. **This is not necessary, you can get started with Gadgetbridge only**. While on original Pebbles this screen could be bypassed by a long press on the right button, newer pebbles seem to be stuck in recovery until a firmware gets flashed.

We recommend to flash the latest available firmware. On the Pebble and Pebble Steel (black and white models), this includes flashing a migration firmware first.

For flashing the firmware with Gadgetbridge see [[this wiki article|Pebble Firmware updates]].
