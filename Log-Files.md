#Log File Location

If you enable logging in the "Debug" screen, the log file will be stored on your external sdcard in `/sdcard/Android/data/nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge/files/gadgetbridge.log`

**Note**: up to version 0.9.4, you need to quit and restart Gadgetbridge to make the log setting work.
