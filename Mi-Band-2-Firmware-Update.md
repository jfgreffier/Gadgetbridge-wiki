## CAUTION
This feature **has the potential to brick your Mi Band 2**! That said, this has never happened to any of the developers, but remember **you're doing this at your own risk**.

## Getting the firmware
Since we may not distribute the firmware, you have to do a little work. You need to find and download a Mi Fit APK file. There is an APK Mirror Web site that might help you find Mi Fit. Extract the downloaded .apk file with "unzip", and you will find an `assets/` directory containing `*.fw` files, among others.

## Installing the firmware
Copy the desired Mi Band 2 firmware file to your Android device and open it from any file manager on that device. The Gadgetbridge FW/App Installer activity should then be started and guide you through the installation process.
