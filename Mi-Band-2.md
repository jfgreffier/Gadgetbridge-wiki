- [[Mi Band 2 Firmware Update]]
- [[Mi Band 2 (HMZK) Font Format]]

## Fonts

To Display text notifications, you need to install a font, as those are not installed on the device my default.

This process is identical to the *Mi Band 2 Firmware Update* process above. After extracting the APK, select the `Mili_pro.ft.en` file instead.
