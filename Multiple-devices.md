### Multiple Android devices and one Gadget
It is possible to share one Gadget among multiple Android devices, but only one device can be connected at a time; furthermore the implication would be that chunks of your health data will be send to different android devices (so you won't have a complete set on any of them; [source](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/issues/322#issuecomment-223714965)).

This will change with releases of Gadgetbridge _after_ v0.10.0 â€“ at least [if you use Pebble Health for that](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/commit/968d15c8d8143af66f4a2e1d7af3d8e73f1daf79): You make one device the "Master" (selecting "Pebble Health" as "Preferred Activitytracker" in Pebble settings on it), and the other the "Slave" (selecting nothing or anything else there but make sure [*not* having ticked on "Pebble Health" there as "Preferred Activitytracker"](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/issues/322#issuecomment-223765820); if your purpose is just to preserve your health data for the main device, it doesn't matter whether the *Misfit* or *Morpheus* apps are installed on your Android device). Same way it should work with *Misfit* and *Morpheus* if you just [disable synchronizing health data for them on the secondary device](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/commit/32429df7bc81a817b841ba7a3811b551ccb22af9).


### Multiple Gadgets and one Android device
This is currently not possible, as [Gadgetbridge only allows one device to be connected at a time](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/issues/305#issuecomment-219798461). It is [technically possible](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/issues/305#issuecomment-221086169), though, and thoughts are being made. But it's not yet on the roadmap for one of the next releases.
