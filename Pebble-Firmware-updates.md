**FIRMWARE UPDATES ARE ALWAYS AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

Based on our tests the following should be possible:

* Up or downgrade from any 1.x/2.x firmware to any 1.x/2.x firmware.
* Up or downgrade from 3.x to any 3.x.

**WARNING: IF YOU WANT TO UPDATE your OG pebble from 2.x to 3.x, please do the following**

1. Flash the migration firmware (eg. 3.x-migration_v1_5_v3.8-beta6.pbz) and **wait till the Pebble reboots, ignoring errors if any** 
2. The pebble will start in a 3.x recovery, flash the real firmware from there (eg. Pebble-3.8-beta9-v1_5.pbz)

**NOTE: Install firmware files from .pbz files by selecting them from a file manager and opening them in Gadgetbridge's App/FW Installer**
