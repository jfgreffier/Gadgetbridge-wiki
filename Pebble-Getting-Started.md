All Pebbles when powered up for the first time demand that you connect in via the official App. **This is not necessary, you can get started with Gadgetbridge only**. While on original Pebbles this screen could be bypassed by a long press on the right button, newer pebbles seem to be stuck in recovery until a firmware gets flashed.

We recommend to flash the latest available firmware. On the Pebble and Pebble Steel (black and white models), this includes flashing a migration firmware first.

Steps to follow:
* Install Gadgetbridge
* Pair your Pebble through Android's Bluetooth Settings (**NOT THE Pebble LE** , **Pebble 2 has to be paired by pressing the + in Control Center**)
* Start Gadgetbridge and tap on your Pebble until it says initialized
* Flash a firmware as noted in [[this wiki article|Pebble Firmware updates]] ** Flashing the firmware is UNTESTED for Pebble 2 and could get stuck, it would not brick the Pebble**
* Install a language pack as noted in [[this wiki article|Pebble-Language-Packs]]
