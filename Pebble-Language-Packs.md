Language packs (.pbl) on the pebble serve two purposes:

* Adding a translation for the Pebble OS
* Adding new characters (eg. Chinese characters)

Only one language pack can be installed at a time and it is possible to switch beween english and the installed language's pack language. When switching to English while a language pack is installed, additional characters made available by the language pack will still be readable when notifications include these.

There are official language packs which can be downloaded here:

Also a bunch of unofficial language packs exist:
