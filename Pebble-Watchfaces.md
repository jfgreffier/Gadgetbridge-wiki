## Pebble Watchfaces
This page is about apps running on your Pebble, also called „Watchfaces“.

### Where can I find Watchfaces?
You can find them on many places. The official source for watchfaces is the corresponding section in the Pebble store: [Watchfaces](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/watchfaces?dev_settings=true). There you can browse through a large collection of watchfaces and, following the button on the end of each watchface page, download them via the „Download PBW“ button.

There are also several free and open-source watchfaces you can find here at Github. The Gadgetbridge team e.g. recommends:

* [Mario Time](https://github.com/ClusterM/pebble-mario)
* [Mini Dungeon](https://github.com/Torivon/MiniDungeon)

### How do I install them to my Pebble?
Once the `.pbw` files are on your Android device running Gadgetbridge (either because you've downloaded them there, or copied them over from your computer), simply tap the file in the file manager of your choice (or the „Downloads“ app). A popup will appear asking you what to open it with. Chose the Gadgetbridge „FW/App Installer“, and the watchface will be installed to your Pebble. If you download a watchface directly on the device running Gadgetbridge, your browser might even prompt you to:

<sup>Install a watchface from within the file manager / install it directly from the browser</sup>

### How do I manage installed watchfaces?
Once you've installed a watchface, Gadgetbridge will cache it. So tapping your device in Gadgetbridge (when it's connected) brings you to the app manager. Long-tap (alias „tap-and-hold“) the entry of an app will bring up a context menu with available actions:

As the screenshot shows, here you can reinstall an app (in case you've deleted it), delete it from the watch, or delete it from the watch and the Gadgetbridge cache.

Note: With Firmware 3.x Gadgetbridge has no means of determining which watchfaces are installed on your Pebble. Hence it can only tell what's in its cache, so please don't wonder.
