### [Meerun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bwa.meerun)
Works, no known issues
### Pebble Dialer
Works on Pebble classic, might be broken or incomplete on Pebble Time, since it distinguishes between Aplite and Basalt (for caller pictures). Needs more testing.
### [Ventoo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.njackson)
Works, no known issues
### [Canvas for Pebble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pennas.pebblecanvas)
Does not work. Complains about `Pebble not connected`. [#130](../issues/130) One can manually install the pbw from `/sdcard0/Android/data/com.pennas.pebblecanvas/files/`. Might work with Gadgetbridge > 0.7.2
### [Push to Pebble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mohammadag.pushtopebble)
Does not Work. Complains about `No Pebble Connected or Pebble app not installed`. [#130](../issues/130).  Might work with Gadgetbridge > 0.7.2
### [RunnerUp](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=runnerup&fdid=org.runnerup)
Works, and simply uses the „Sports“ system app (if you've enabled that in Gadgetbridge [Pebble settings](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Configuration#pebble-specific-settings))
