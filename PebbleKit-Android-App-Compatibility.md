### [Canvas for Pebble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pennas.pebblecanvas)
Does not work. Complains about `Pebble not connected`. [#130](../issues/130) One can manually install the pbw from `/sdcard0/Android/data/com.pennas.pebblecanvas/files/`. Might work with Gadgetbridge > 0.7.2

### Pebble Dialer
Works on Pebble classic, might be broken or incomplete on Pebble Time, since it distinguishes between Aplite and Basalt (for caller pictures). Needs more testing.
