In theory we want to support all good and wide-spread devices.

In practice, someone needs to have the time and the information to implement support for it. If the communication protocol is open, or at least documented somewhere, adding support is rather easy. Ideally, devices would even use standard bluetooth services that we could support in a generic way, with few device specific additions.

We do encourage and support the implementation for new devices. 

When requesting support for a new device, please add the label "request for device" to it. If you found documentation or even a specification about the protocol, please reference it. Such documentation very much increases the probability of supporting the device in question with Gadgetbridge.
