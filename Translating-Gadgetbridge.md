The preferred way to contribute translations is by using Transifex at http://transifex.com/projects/p/gadgetbridge/

To start translating, please 
* create a Transifex account, or connect with your Github account
* request becoming a member of the Gadgetbridge translation team
* and translate :-)

If you don't want to use Transifex, you can alternatively clone our repository, translate the file https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml and submit a pull request.

The translations are usually incorporated shortly before a release.
