#Mi Band firmware upgrade/downgrade#
**CAUTION: This feature is currently highly discouraged, as it has the potential to brick the Mi Band!**

Copy the desired Mi Band firmware as a `*.fw` file to your Android device and open it from any file manager on that device. The firmware update activity should then be started.
